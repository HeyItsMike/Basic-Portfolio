            <p>My name is Mike Wylie, I have created this website with my own two hands. Actually I used a Macbook Pro but thats
                beside the point. I summoned you to this very web page to admire the sheer persistence it takes to make such
                a site. Not tooting my own horn here this thing took some work jack! At one point I was ready to turn my
                laptop into a $1500 frisbee and send it through the window. I like to make videos, skateboard and I guess
                code. Nobody likes doing something when you suck at it so check in later when I can make something cooler!</p>
